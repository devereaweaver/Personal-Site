I built my first terrarium with materials that I purchased from
<a class="accent-word" href="https://www.bwillow.com">B.Willow</a>. 

The open terrarium is made up of five layers:
1. *Activated charcoal* - absorbs toxins and helps to prevent mold growth and rotting
2. *Sand* - helps absorb water from the soil layer to prevent rotting
3. *Gravel* - acts as a reservoir for excess water to pool away from the soil, also prevents root rot
4. *Retentive soil* - soil layer for plants

After adding each layer, finally I removed my plants from their nursery pots into the soil layer. So, I'm not 100% sure the variety of plants I have; however, I do know they're both from the <a class="accent-word" href="https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-dracaena-6825681">*dracaena*</a> genus of plants. 

In the picture above, I believe the plant on the right is a <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/dracaena-janet-craig-care-8551131" class="accent-word">*dracaena janet craig*</a>. I'm still not entire sure the variety of one on the left but if I had to guess it's one of the following:
* <span class="accent-word">*Dracaena sanderiana ‚ÄòWhite Stripe‚Äô*</span>
* <span class="accent-word">*Dracaena reflexa 'Song of India'*</span>
* <span class="accent-word">*Dracaena warnock 'Warneckii'*</span>
* <span class="accent-word">*Dracaena fragrans 'Lemon Lime'*</span>

...ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Either way, since they're of the same genus and have a pretty similar variety, their care is relatively straightforward and pretty low maintenance. Just check the soil every 10-14 days to see if they need watering. Also if their leave begin to "thin out" they might be a bit dehydrated and can use a spray down. Simple.

Dracaena don't like direct sunlight, most likely because they've evolved under the canopy of taller trees in tropical and subtropical forests. The direct sunlight can cause leaf burn and stress. 

Anyways, the final product ended up looking like this
<div class="image-row">

  <img src="/assets/images/terrarium2.jpeg" alt="Plant 2" />
  <img src="/assets/images/terrarium3.jpeg" alt="Plant 3" />
</div>

Since this was my first one, it definitely didn't turn out *very* pretty or well constructed but practice makes perfect.
