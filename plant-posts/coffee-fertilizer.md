## How to Use

- <span class="accent-word">Houseplants</span>: Water once every 2–4 weeks during growing season 
(check out [<span class="accent-word">this</span>](/plant-posts/plant-fertilization) chart for general fertilization guidelines).

- <span class="accent-word">Outdoor plants</span>: Pour around the base of plants, avoid foliage.

## ⚠️ Notes & Warnings

- Don’t overdo it—too much nitrogen can cause leafy growth at the expense of flowers or fruit.
- Always use <span class="acccent-word">used</span> (i.e. brewed) coffee grounds—fresh ones are too acidic.
- Keep mixture away from pets, caffeine can be toxic to them!
