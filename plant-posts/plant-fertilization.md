### 🌱 **What Does Fertilization Do for Plants?**

Fertilization provides plants with essential <span class="accent-word">nutrients</span> they need to grow strong, healthy, and productive. While soil can supply some nutrients, over time it becomes depleted—especially in pots or heavily used garden beds.

### The "Big Three" Nutrients in Most Fertilizers:

- <span class="accent-word">**N</span> (Nitrogen)** – Helps plants grow lush green leaves and stems. Especially important for leafy vegetables and herbs.
- <span class="accent-word">**P</span> (Phosphorus)** – Supports strong root development, flowering, and fruiting.
- <span class="accent-word">**K</span> (Potassium)** – Boosts overall plant health and resistance to disease and stress.

There are also <span class="accent-word">micronutrients</span> like calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, etc., which play smaller but still important roles.

Below is a chart that offers some *general* guidelines to fertilization for different types of plants. 
It might not be exact or precise to your plants, so adjust accordingly. 

| Plant Type | Growing Season Frequency | Off Season Frequency | Nutrient Focus | Notes/Tips |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Houseplants | Every 2–4 weeks | Once a month or pause | Balanced (10-10-10) | Water first, then fertilize; flush soil occasionally to prevent buildup. |
| Leafy Greens | Weekly | Stop after harvest | High Nitrogen (N) | Compost tea or fish emulsion works great; avoid overfeeding. |
| Fruiting Veggies | Every 10–14 days | N/A | P-K Rich | Use tomato fertilizer or compost tea; support fruit with potassium (K). |
| Herbs (indoors) | Every 2–3 weeks | Once a month | Mild Balanced | Too much fertilizer reduces flavor; dilute more than usual. |
| Flowering Plants | Every 2 weeks | Pause after bloom | High Phosphorus (P) | Use bloom booster or banana peel compost tea for flowers. |
| Succulents & Cacti | Every 4–6 weeks (spring) | None in winter | Low Nitrogen | Use half-strength cactus fertilizer; overfeeding = leggy growth. |
| Perennials | 1–2 times per year | None | Balanced or K-heavy | Early spring and midsummer; mulch after for slow nutrient release. |
| Shrubs & Trees | Once in early spring | None | Depends on type | Use slow-release pellets; don't fertilize in fall—encourages new growth. |
